# JavaScript FlashCards - Module 2 - Solo Project - Jan McSorley

## Abstract
The purpose of this project was to use a partially constructed application to create a functional flash card program that runs in the terminal. One of the primary goals was to practice Test Driven Development principles by building a test suite with Mocha/Chai. The final outcome is an application that allows a user to see a question with a list of answers in the terminal, choose an answer, and see their final score.
